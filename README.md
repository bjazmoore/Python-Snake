# Python-Snake
A version of the traditional snake program created interactively as an exercise in seeing what ChatGPT was capable of doing.  I wrote an article about the experience.  It is published [here](https://bitsbytesandpieces.com/home/the-state-of-ai-coding-today).
Download a windows executable [here](https://github.com/bjazmoore/Python-Snake/releases/download/snake/snake.exe).
Thanks
